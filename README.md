# DnD_Scripts
Scripts I made for D&amp;D while learning PowerShell

I created a script to roll stats using the 4d6 method as a joke for my players who keep rolling over and over until they get a character they like. You can change the number of characters it creates and it writes them both to write-host and csv. 

There is also a collection of scripts for a module for dice rolls and generating random treasure like in the DMG. Just copy the folder DnD-Scripts to $HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\<Module Folder>\<Module Files> and then they will be avaliable in PowerShell.
